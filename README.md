Figure 1. **Top**:¬†Model performance on the Grounding benchmarks and Agent benchmarks. Higher and more left is better. With only 3k training samples, SE-GUI-3B/7B reaches scores up to 35.8/47.2.¬†**Bottom**:¬†Illustration of action attention with prompt "Pin Jack's Conversation."

## :sparkles: Highlights
üéØ **Seed Data Curation**  We curate a 3,018-sample dataset by filtering out vague, inaccurate, or overly simple tasks from a larger candidate pool. This ensures linguistic consistency and balanced task complexity, promoting better generalization and stable performance across scenarios.

üöÄ **Group Relative Policy Optimization with Dense Point Reward.** To combat sparse rewards, we designed a continuous reward mechanism that evaluates the proximity between predictions and ground truth. This provides smoother feedback, enabling the model to learn from near-misses and gradually refine its grounding behavior.

üî• **Self-Evolutionary Reinforcement Fine-Tuning.** We implement an iterative learning loop, where attention maps serve as intermediate supervision signals. These maps highlight which visual tokens the model attends to for each instruction, helping align its focus with relevant interface elements over time.

<!-- ## :fire: News
* **[2025.06.03]**  We released the GUI-Actor training/inference code and model checkpoints!

## :rescue_worker_helmet: Installation
1. Clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
https://github.com/YXB-NKU/SE-GUI.git
cd SE-GUI
```
2. Create a conda environment and install the dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n se_gui python=3.10
conda activate se_gui
bash setup.sh
```
## :minidisc: Data Preparation
1. Download the processed data from [here (coming soon)]().
2. Modify the paths in the [data_config.yaml](./data/data_config.yaml) file to point to the downloaded data.

## :building_construction: Model Training
```
Full-parameter training stage:
```bash
bash src/open-r1-multimodal/run_scripts/run_grpo_gui_grounding.sh
```

## :checkered_flag: Evaluation on GUI Grounding Benchmarks
For evaluation on ScreenSpot and ScreenSpot-v2, you can directly run the scripts under the `scripts/` folder like `python eval/screenSpot.py` or `python eval/screenSpot_v2.py`.

For evaluation on ScreenSpot-Pro, you first need to download the data from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/likaixin/ScreenSpot-Pro), then run the following command:
```bash
python eval/screenSpot_pro.py --save_path <path_to_save_results> --data_path <path_to_data_dir>
```

Example usage:
```python
import torch

from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import Qwen2VLProcessor
from gui_actor.constants import chat_template
from gui_actor.modeling import Qwen2VLForConditionalGenerationWithPointer

# load model
model_name_or_path = "SE-GUI-7B"
data_processor = Qwen2VLProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
tokenizer = data_processor.tokenizer

    model_name_or_path,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="cuda:0",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"
).eval()

# prepare example
dataset = load_dataset("rootsautomation/ScreenSpot")["test"]
example = dataset[0]
print(f"Intruction: {example['instruction']}")
print(f"ground-truth action region (x1, y1, x2, y2): {[round(i, 2) for i in example['bbox']]}")

conversation = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "You are a GUI agent. You are given a task and a screenshot of the screen. You need to perform a series of pyautogui actions to complete the task.",
            }
        ]
    },

                # "image_url": "https://xxxxx.png" or "https://xxxxx.jpg" or "file://xxxxx.png" or "data:image/png;base64,xxxxxxxx", will be split by "base64,"
            },
            {
